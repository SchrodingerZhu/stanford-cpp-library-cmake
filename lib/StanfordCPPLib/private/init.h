/*
 * File: init.h
 * ------------
 * This file contains code to check whether the Stanford C++ library has been
 * initialized, and if not, to initialize it.
 * This file must be included by every student-facing header in the Stanford
 * C++ library to make sure that the library is initialized before it is used.
 *
 * There used to be a group of files such as private/main.h, main.cpp, and
 * startup.cpp that contained various initialization code.  These were removed
 * and replaced with this style of initialization for the following reasons:
 *
 * - simplicity/consolidation
 * - allow student to NOT include console.h and use plain text console
 *
 * @version 2018/08/28
 * - refactor to use stanfordcpplib namespace and init.cpp
 * @version 2018/07/03
 * - add code to handle Qt GUI library initialization
 * @version 2017/04/25
 * - wrap library initializer in an #ifndef to avoid multiple declaration
 *
 * TODO: figure out how to support both 0-arg and 2-arg main()
