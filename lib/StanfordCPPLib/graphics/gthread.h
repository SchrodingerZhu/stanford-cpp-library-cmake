/*
 * File: gthread.h
 * ---------------
 *
 * This file contains code related to multithreading.
 * Qt requires at least two threads to run: a main Qt GUI thread,
 * and a separate student code thread.
 * The student's main() function runs in this latter student thread.
 * You can also run code in a new thread using the static method
 * GThread::runInNewThread or GThread::runInNewThreadAsync.
 *
 * @version 2018/10/18
 * - improved thread names
 * @version 2018/09/08
 * - added doc comments for new documentation generation
 * @version 2018/08/23
 * - renamed to gthread.h to replace Java version
 * @version 2018/07/28
 * - initial version

 * The GThread class is a utility class containing static methods that allow
 * you to run code on various system threads.
 * The library has the following two standard threads running at all times:
 *
 * <ol>
 *     <li> The Qt GUI thread, which runs Qt's master exec() loop,
 *          handles all GUI object creation and events
 *          (this is technically the program's main thread)
 *
 *     <li> The student thread, which runs the student's main() function and
 *          any sub-functions called by main
 *
 * Students and clients normally do not need to worry about threading issues.
 * These methods are called internally by many of the graphical interactors
 * to make sure that all internal Qt GUI widgets are initialized on the Qt GUI
 * thread.  This is required for them to function properly.
 *
 * If you want to run a piece of code in its own thread, use static methods
 * <code>GThread::runInNewThread</code> and
 * <code>GThread::runInNewThreadAsync</code>.
