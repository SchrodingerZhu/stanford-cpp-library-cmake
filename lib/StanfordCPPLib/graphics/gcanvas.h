/**
 * A GCanvas is a graphical drawing surface on which you can draw shapes, lines,
 * and colors, as well as setting the RGB color values of individual pixels.
 *
 * The graphical canvas consists of two layers:
 *
 * 1) The background layer provides a surface for drawing static pictures that
 * involve no animation, or for 2D pixel-based drawing algorithms.
 * The class includes several drawXxx and fillXxx methods that draw
 * lines, rectangles, and ovals on the background layer.
 *
 * The setPixel and setPixels methods manipulate the color of pixels in the
 * background layer.  You can get all of the pixels as a Grid using getPixels,
 * modify the grid, then pass it back in using setPixels, to perform 2D
 * pixel-based manipulations on the canvas.
 *
 * 2) The foreground layer provides an abstraction for adding stateful shapes and
 * graphical objects onto the canvas.  The add() methods that accept GObject
 * parameters place these objects onto the foreground layer.  The advantage of
 * the foreground layer is that you can manipulate the object over time, such as
 * moving it, changing its color, size, or other properties, and see these
 * changes immediately on the screen.  This makes the foreground layer most
 * appropriate for animations or moving sprites.
 *
 * A GCanvas is implicitly added to the center of every GWindow when the client
 * calls the window's add(), drawXxx/fillXxx, or other methods.  In most cases
 * the window just forwards these method calls to its internal GCanvas, which
 * performs the bulk of the work.
 *
 * See gobjects.h for more detail about drawing shapes and objects.
